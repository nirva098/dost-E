Enlisting existing resources & possible implementation. 

1. Existing rule based AIs 
eg. ELIZA, ELIZA was one of the first chatterbots (later clipped to chatbot). It was also an early test case for the Turing Test, a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. By today's standards ELIZA fails very quickly if you ask it a few complex questions.
